1. Describe the dataset. (ex: Information about Traffic violations in Montgomery County, MD; or The number of microaneurysms found in a patient's eye and whether or not they have diabetic retinopathy.)
The dataset is gathered from experimental speed dating events. Based on the participants' interaction at the event, they gave ratings to their partners and themselves.

2. How many records does the dataset have?
8378.

3. How many features does the dataset have? List or describe a few of them.
123. Some features are gender, age, interests(hiking, gaming, etc.), attributes(attractiveness, sincerity, etc.). Participants gave a rating on interest based on their preference and rated both their partners and themselves on the attributes.

4. What can you try to predict in this dataset? (ex: We can try using the features, including age, race, gender, car make and model, etc, to predict the type of traffic violation; or We can use the number of microaneurysms measured in the patient's eye to predict whether or not they have diabetic retinopathy.)
Using the features, we can try to predict if a person would be able to find a match. We could also use the features to predict which interests or attributes have a higher probability of getting a match.

5. Is this a labeled dataset, appropriate for a supervised learning classification problem? (In other words, if you are trying to predict whether or not someone has a disease, does your dataset contain whether or not each record has the disease?)
Yes.

6. Provide a link to the dataset, if there is one. If you are getting your data from somewhere other than a link, where are you getting it from?
